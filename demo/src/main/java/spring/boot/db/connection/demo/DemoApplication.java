9. Extensibility for Other Databases

    Abstract Database Service: The current DummyService can be generalized into an abstract class or interface, allowing new implementations for different databases.
    Factory Pattern: Create a DatabaseServiceFactory to dynamically provide the correct service implementation based on configuration.
    Repository Layer: Implement different repositories for various databases, extending a generic base interface.

This setup follows the principles of modularity, reusability, and ease of maintenance, ensuring that you can easily extend it for other databases or entities in the future. Let me know if youâ€™d like to proceed further with any additional features or databases!
